## Introduction

Our API is organized around GraphQL. We’re convinced GraphQL is the future of APIs - it allows much finer command than other technologies such as REST. Payloads are typed and it’s efficient for reducing cascading requests.

This API reference includes:

- **Guides**: step-by-step tutorials show you how to integrate our features
- **Concept documentation**: describes every single part of the API in detail
- **API Explorer**: Test everything. Our favorite explorer said, “The most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or touched, they are felt with the heart.” ...well, you’ll quickly get a feel for how beautiful you can make your product experience when you test with our API Explorer!
